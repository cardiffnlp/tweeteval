I think @user character on #ThisIsUs is probably one of the best dads ever on a tv show.
@user you are so beautiful and an inspiration. #ThisIsUs is my husband's and my favorite show.
We must catch the moments while we're young and quick, for soon we will be old and slow. #ThisIsUs

@user whoever is narrating the trailer for #thisisus should be sacked!  Silly c*w thinks saying 'thizizuz' is perhaps alluring! Wrong!!
@user @user Link to review for #ThisIsUs isn't launching.
@user she's not half as bad as the stupid cow currently narrating the trailer for #thisisus - just hear her ridiculous take #thizizuz
Good for Kate for recognizing that she needs to be happy with herself to be happy with Toby. #ThisIsUs

@user Trump may indeed fail, but YOU endorsed a corrupt warmonger, now closely affiliated with a DC pedophile sex ring? #HugeFail
@user @user ....why if one disagrees with some one on twitter,Facebook etc.,you immediately become a hater,how about critic ?

@user @user Canadian site is flooded with fake reviews on #SettleForMore !
Still reading #SettleForMore @user #fridayreads
@user that's not true you have 60million Trumpsters who hate you, boycott your show and think you are a smug arrogant bitch
@user @user @user @user In June, I cut off Fox altogether! Dana, Juan, and Megyn all bat for the other team.
@user @user what do these '1/2 naked pics' have to do with anything? They're not even like that.
@user @user desrespectful to what, a piece of trash that calls herself a "journalist" Shows you how low the profession's fallen
@user @user sport figures & certain celebrities can be seen as heroes.
@user @user  if you have only one life it would alredy over, you 2 face shit
@user @user // I'm sure Megyn will have the check in the mail this afternoon.
@user @user I'm sure it is a NYT #1 best-seller for a reason.

@user because megyn lost all respect once she jumped on the roger harassed me too..... but took the prime time slot job?
@user @user when did she say she supported him?
@user Megyn, Please interview Halderman from the Univ of Michigan re:discrepancy in the results in counties with e-voting machines.
@user @user @user you have a lot of hate in your heart 4someone claiming to be Christian. There is no need to be nasty.
@user @user she clearly does! she did better & now has a better life. work hard & look after what you really need & want
@user @user @user @user @user WHY ARE YOU NOT TALKING ABOUT THE COUNTRY WIDE #ARSON HAPPENING.‚Ä¶
@user @user @user @user Agreed
@user YOURE SO FULL OF YOURSELF! YOU KNOW U NEVER RECEIVED ANY THREATS FROM TRUMP OR HIS SUPPORTERS! MAYBE TH‚Ä¶
@user @user too many morons out there. Ppl get ruffled when someone says something they don't agree with. Want an echo chamber
@user @user why read about her tears?
@user @user @user one thing is to have an opinion about something, another to go after her the way some ppl are
@user  News story.  Steven Crain is actually innocent.
@user @user Just what what we need, cry, so we can feel sorry for her waaaaa
@user how and why hateful messages to her anyway. A very bright, compassionate high achiever?
Anybody else sick of @user selling her book all over twitter and @user ??
@user @user of course! but since when does opinion have to = disrespect, nasty comments
@user @user audition for Clinton News Network?
We're watching closely exactly who works to normalize this creepy fringe. @user @user @user @user
@user @user this is so irrelevant to her career & persona life. You know how interviews with Stern go.
@user @user full of herself? I mean it is a book about her life. Everything that happened w her in last year was newsworthy
@user @user watch her every night! Love the way she challenges people, presents stories, stays objective. True journalism!
@user @user it's one thing to disagree, another to be hateful. I saw the latter in my mentions after she quoted my tweet.
@user @user Well, good for you!
@user @user problem is the power of celebrity and propaganda. Unfortunately truth doesn't always win. Internet and false news?
@user @user she's a great journalist, not sure where you get the 'piece of trash' you are talking about
@user @user @user @user You haven't missed a thing by not watching @user
@user good adage. i like the slogan: "Love Trumps Hate"
@user  are they all from @user  Who cares
@user @user @user begging for book sales & playing a victim isnt cool, PC crap is over
@user @user no doubt ur a complete BIMBO.. trump made ur career anyway.. arrogant bitch
@user @user No, it's that others didn't have Roger Ailes to advance their careers!!! Only to back stab him later.
@user I think you forgot to follow your own advice. IMO. @user
@user @user @user what does that have to do with PC? + she's only promoting her book. was a victim too.
@user @user I'd disagree with you Bruce. Read her book. I'd be happy to gift it to you, if you are willing to read it.
@user @user @user no hate in my heart! I don't like fake people hypocrites who point there finger at others to gain $
Love @user ! We need to see more of her on @user . Maybe replace @user ?
@user @user loooooooooool yea if you're willing to fuck Roger Ailes for a job @user
@user @user ....then don't just simply brand everyone and anyone who disagrees with you as a "hater" in a generalization !
@user @user @user not sure where you are getting that from. Oh and your last tweet is hateful/disrespectful
@user @user maybe bc 2 big headed 2 snarky 2 childish 2 animated 2 sarcastic 2 many hand gestures 2 anti Trump  is that enough?
@user @user when did I do that? The minute I tweeted that, everyone replying to my tweet was being hateful.
@user @user she said she was a hostage to big bad Trump for over a year. Wtf, PC would be not calling her on her crap
@user @user You should take over her show permanently.
@user @user  Nice, and i'm with you on that!
Pretty inspiring to see where people came from and how it shaped who they are today. Really enjoying your book so far @user
@user @user not sure where you get all of that from. And even of some of those were true, that makes it okay to send hateful tweets
@user @user we all have "personal life's" with a story to tell! I dislike her fake emotions & attitude
@user @user I'm sure Trump's actions & words did make her life a living hell for a while. Can't blame her.
@user @user @user posting pictures of Ms. Kelly while making slanderous comments is pretty hateful. Name-calling.....
@user @user Not a Fox fan but I respect MK. Good luck with your book dear!
@user @user fake emotions & attitude? You're making things up.
@user @user Because it's the TRUTH! Ppl will not see the truth or the LIGHT with blind eyes. Don't stop using ur voice!
@user @user @user Learning from those who cause massive attention can be useful if you wanna do it too, or prevent it.
@user is there a special way you could sign my Kindle version of your book? It's the one downfall of the e-book empire
@user @user Don't waste your time and money. Better to buy some toilet cleaner. Stop allowing her to push her political BS
@user @user ...time for you to go down to riverwalk for coffee !Buh bye......
@user @user @user @user @user Media What More Proof Do You Need?
@user @user lmao, his words made her a hostage? Wow thats pathetic, maybe she should interview a real pow and grow the f up

@user @user @user @user Please, dude. You probably loved her until she stood up to your boy.
@user @user @user interesting news is exciting - doesn't mean she is being dishonest in her work.

Arguing that alt-right (aka neo-fascism) isn't a usable term is a crass relativism... stop talking just know all alt-rightists are fascists
If their great-grandfathers who fought in WWII could see alt-rightists applauding "Hail Trump," they'd give them such an ass-kicking...
Alt-Rightists don't need interpreters, excusers, and filters. They are candid about what they believe & intend. They should be listened to.
I always look forward to going home and then I remember that half my family is a bunch of alt-rightists sigh why tho

@user @user @user I tend to agree.  I was basing my observations on lectures given by different "alt-rightists"
@user Vic, I think he's just busy explaining why those Nazi salutes yesterday weren't real:
@user Better to see "alt-rightists proudly do Nazi salute" than "racists do it". Keep their chosen label assoc w their reviled behavior
@user Spencer is even one of the softer alt-rightists. I guess Paul doesn't know much about shitposting and chan culture.
@user the horsehoe theory AND the bell curve. mmm this will put those alt-rightists to task boy howdy
Well, @user you are right. This is no true fascist movement. We are being treated to an amateurish copy.

It is more accurate to say that anti-identity politics arguments have different bases among leftists and liberals.

Trump didn't win the popular vote. That's not OUR president. But he's greenlighting the pipeline when he gets in office. FOR "US".
